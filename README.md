# Drupal-Bonev

The app allows an authorized user to
1) Add Musis artists with a short synopsis of their history
2) Add Albums linked to artists and the genres of the album
3) Add musical Genres

Every Artist can have a Contact form added.

Note: Custom module has some SQL schema and CRUD functionality that I mistakenly started writing before making use of the Drupal Content Types, I couldn't think of any way to link a custom module with the app so I've left the CRUD in /music.
